# Gen X Jumps 7-Day Plan App

This repository contains the mobile-first Gen X Jumps app that builds and delivers a personalized seven-day workout and protein plan.

The repository and Lovable project still use the historical working name `Gen X Comeback`. That is a project slug, not a locked public product title.

## Current status

The core seven-day plan experience is implemented and connected to Lovable Cloud. The Plan Ready email foundation is also implemented, but outbound email remains intentionally fail-closed until the remaining provider configuration and end-to-end acceptance checks pass.

### Implemented app experience

- Public offer and entry screen
- Multi-step fitness assessment
- Personalized results preview
- Lead capture and consent after the schedule preview
- Transactional persistence of the lead, assessment, consent, and current plan
- Deterministic workout and recovery-day assignments
- Immediate Day 1 access after a successful save
- Days 2-7 plan access and workout-day routes
- Saved-plan return access without requiring a password
- Plan progress and day-completion behavior
- Guided workout video delivery
- Post-plan jump-rope recommendation page
- Responsive mobile and desktop layouts
- PWA manifest and installable-app foundation

### Implemented Plan Ready email foundation

- App-owned durable outbox
- Idempotent Plan Ready job creation
- Job leasing, retry handling, and stale-job alerts
- Replaceable delivery-provider adapter with Resend support
- Secure, purpose-limited return tokens
- Deliberate **Open My Plan** confirmation before a saved plan is activated
- Signed provider-webhook verification and event reconciliation
- Bounce and complaint suppression
- App-owned email preferences
- A release gate that blocks provider calls unless every required setting and acceptance flag is present

Only Plan Ready is currently implemented for delivery. The remaining approved lifecycle emails and user-requested recovery email are later checkpoints. Broadcasts, newsletters, and promotional campaigns are outside the current app-email scope.

## Architecture

- **Frontend and server:** React 19, TypeScript, TanStack Start, and TanStack Router
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS 4 with Radix/shadcn-style components
- **Backend:** Lovable Cloud with PostgreSQL/Supabase-compatible services
- **Email transport:** Resend, used only as a replaceable delivery pipe
- **Testing:** Vitest
- **Hosting and project control:** Lovable
- **Version history:** GitHub, synchronized with the connected Lovable project

The app database is authoritative for plans, consent, email eligibility, job state, suppression, and send history. Email delivery must never control product access.

## Email release safety

Real sending must stay disabled until domain authentication, sender configuration, webhook signing, dispatch authorization, safe preflight, email preview, return-flow inspection, and staging acceptance are complete.

Do not enable outbound sending merely because a provider API key exists. The server-side sending gate must report every prerequisite satisfied before any real provider attempt is allowed.

## Local development

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is recommended because this repository includes a Bun lockfile.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/genxjumps/gen-x-comeback.git
cd gen-x-comeback
bun install
bun run dev
```

Run the verification commands before committing application changes:

```sh
bun run test
bunx tsc --noEmit
bun run lint
bun run build
```

Keep server credentials and signing secrets out of source control.

## Lovable

- **Live app:** https://gen-x-comeback.lovable.app
- **Lovable editor:** https://lovable.dev/projects/9882f922-c17b-4fca-bd5b-48b9548e5322

Changes pushed to the connected `main` branch synchronize back to Lovable. Avoid force pushes, rebases, amendments, or squashes that rewrite published history.
